# About Me

My name is **Soumya Ranjan Parida**. I’m 21 years old and I come from **Cuttack, Odisha**. I started my engineering journey in 2021, not with a clear roadmap, but with curiosity. Like many others, I explored different paths before slowly finding my direction.

During my early years of engineering, I developed a strong curiosity for **web development**. I enjoyed understanding how websites work, how data flows, and how ideas turn into real products on the screen. Over time, I realized that I wasn’t just interested in functionality — I also cared deeply about **how things look and feel**.

About two months ago, I started exploring **design** more seriously. Design helped me think beyond code: spacing, typography, simplicity, and user experience. It taught me that good software isn’t just about logic — it’s also about empathy and clarity.

I’ll be honest: I’m not someone who excels at **DSA** or competitive programming. I don’t define myself by how many problems I can solve. Instead, I enjoy building things that feel meaningful, clean, and usable. I believe consistency matters more than speed.

Outside of tech, I love **solo bike riding** and **swimming**. Riding alone helps me clear my head, and swimming keeps me grounded and focused.

I’m still learning, still improving, and still figuring things out — but I genuinely enjoy the process. For me, growth isn’t about being the best; it’s about being better than yesterday.
