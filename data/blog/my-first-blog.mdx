## Introduction

This is my **first blog written using MDX** 🎉  

I am building my developer portfolio using **Next.js App Router**, and MDX allows me to write blogs using **Markdown with superpowers**.

---

## What is MDX?

MDX is like Markdown, but better.

With MDX, I can:
- Write simple text like Markdown
- Add **code blocks**
- Later, even use **React components inside blogs**

For now, I am keeping it simple 😊

---

## Example Code Block

Here is a small example of JavaScript code:

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
